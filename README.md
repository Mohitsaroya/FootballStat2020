# Statistical-Analysis-of-Top-Europian-Football-Leagues-From-year-2020-2021

This project highlights the use of Python for statistical analysis of data to produce meaningful outcomes. Users can choose the specific data they want to explore and how they want it to be presented. The project is designed to display data to a broad audience, providing insights into topics that benefit from visual representation for better understanding. It includes information on the top players in football history and comparisons between the chart-topping and lowest-performing clubs in various leagues. Additionally, users can explore the top 10 football clubs, their market values, and revenue generation. The project also offers an option to learn the terminology used in data visualization and analysis.

# Version 1

The original program that I wrote in 12th grade for Computer Science project. It is completely unaltered and is posted as it was made in 2022, and has a lot of inconsistencies that I am targetting to work upon in the second version.

# Version 2

The altered version; I am currently working on it.
